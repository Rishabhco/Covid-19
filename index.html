            <div id="intro">
                <p>
                    A coronavirus is a kind of common virus that causes an infection in your nose, sinuses, or upper
                    throat. Most coronaviruses aren't dangerous.
                    In early 2020, after a December 2019 outbreak in China, the World Health Organization identified
                    SARS-CoV-2 as a new type of coronavirus. The outbreak quickly spread around the world.
                    COVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that can trigger what doctors call a respiratory tract
                    infection. It can affect your upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) or lower
                    respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs).

                        <li>
                            Masks should be worn in addition to staying at least 6 feet apart, especially around people

                            If someone in your household is infected, people in the household should take precautions
                            including wearing
                            masks to avoid spread to others.

                            Disposable face masks should be used once and then thrown in the trash. You should also remove and replace masks when they become moist.

                            Physical distancing in indoor and outdoor spaces is an essential way to slow down the spread of COVID-19.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

                        <li>
                            Remember that some people without symptoms may be able to spread virus.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arm lengths) from other people.Keeping distance from others is
                            especially
                            important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick.
                        </li>

                            With limited child care options and people working from home, it may be tempting to let kids gather together. But physical distancing only works if we all participate. And slowing down or preventing the spread of the virus will save lives.

                            If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60%
                            alcohol.
                            Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.

                        <li>
                            Avoid indoor spaces that do not offer fresh air from the outdoors as much as possible.

                        <li>
                            Once you are fully vaccinated, you may be able to start doing some things that you had
                            stopped doing because of the pandemic.

                            Vaccination can mean the difference between life and death:
                            Vaccine-preventable infections can be deadly. Every year in the US, prior to the COVID-19
                            pandemic, approximately 50,000 adults died from vaccine-preventable diseases.

                            When you get sick, your children, grandchildren, and parents may be at risk, too : 
                            Adults are the most common source of pertussis (whooping cough) infection in infants which can be deadly for babies. When you get vaccinated, you are protecting yourself and your family as well as those in your community who may not be able to be vaccinated.

                <p>
                    The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the world in various ways. The deficiency of information, the
                    need for accurate information, and the rapidity of its dissemination are important, as this pandemic
                    requires the cooperation of entire populations. The rapid survey that we conducted had a good
                    response and we show that healthcare professionals and the general public were quite well informed
                    about the coronavirus. They are aware of the measures needed to be taken to reduce the spread of the
                    disease.
                    These are tough times and in these times everyone needs to be safe and stay fit so that they can win
                    battle over
                    COVID-19 but to win this battle the most important hting is to take precautionary measures .
